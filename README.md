# Library 
**Project description:**<br/>
Firstly I created structures for clients, books and transactions and txt files as their database to store all needed information. Then I created three header files respectively with client, books and transaction related functions such as read files and fill the structures with these data , update database and a lot other functions that are explained in code. As well I created a header with needed function to make program a better looking one. Some of these are change of color, delay, replacing the input with asterisk etc. Finally I created the last header file called Library were includes only three functions: client, administrator and library function. Their interaction make functional the entire program.

**Important instruction:**
1.	We you see that program is stuck or is not proceeding just press enter.
2.	Please do not change database files manually because they are directly related with structures. These changes may cause “invalid malloc” or “exited board” or some other errors related with functionality of pointers.
3.	Just enjoy the program.
